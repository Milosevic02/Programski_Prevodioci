# PARSER

## Introduction

This project extends the text grammar by implementing various tasks that require working with a parser. It enhances the grammar of sentences and text structure by introducing additional elements such as questions, exclamations, commas, paragraphs, dramatic dialogues, numbered lists, and optional parentheses.

## Task List

### Task 1: Questions and Exclamations

In this task, the text grammar is expanded to include questions and exclamations. The program counts and displays the number of questions, exclamations, and declarative sentences. At the end of the program, you will find the totals for each category.

### Task 2: Commas

This task extends the text grammar by allowing any two words within a sentence to be separated by a comma. A comma should not appear after the last word in the sentence.

### Task 3: Paragraphs

The text structure is expanded to include paragraphs in this task. A paragraph is a sequence of one or more sentences separated by at least one newline character. The program counts and displays the total number of paragraphs in the text.

### Task 4: Dramatic Dialogues

This task introduces support for dramatic dialogues. A sentence can now be preceded by the name of the character who is speaking, followed by a colon. Characters can take one of three values: HAMLET, KLAUDIJE, or OFELIJA.

### Task 5: Numbered Lists

The text grammar is further extended to include numbered lists. A list is a sequence of one or more items. Each item in the list has the format: NUMBER "." sentence. The number should be an unsigned integer and must not begin with zero. Lists may appear at the beginning of the text but are optional.

### Task 6: Parentheses

For an extra challenge, this task extends the text grammar to include parentheses. Any word or group of words can now appear within parentheses. Optionally, the content inside the parentheses can be empty.

## Conclusion

These exercises demonstrate working with a parser to extend text grammar and structure. Each task adds specific features to the text and provides a more comprehensive understanding of grammatical concepts. Enjoy exploring these enhancements to text representation!
